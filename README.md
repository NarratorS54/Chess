# A Journey of Chess Openings
## A Look at How My Chess Openings Changed Over About 2 Years


### The Start of My Chess in 2020
#### Playing d4 | Queen's Pawn, Zukertort, Chigorin Variation

The Queen's Pawn, Zukertort, Chigorin Variation Opening was a fairly simple first opening to invest time into. It goes **1. d4 d5 2. Nf3 Nc6**. The Pawn on d4 is **overproteced** by the white queen and the knight on c6. This makes this a fairly structurally sound center to develop your pieces around and can be used to play a *London System* (mentioned later in the document).

This was the first Chess opening that I played, and it is a very sound opening at beginner and intermediate level. However, in higher levels, as opponents learn various *King's Indian* or *Dutch Defense* variations, you might no longer see 1. d4 **d5** on the board.


#### Playing c4 | English Opening, Four Knights, Quiet Line

The next major opening I played was the English Opening. This is a fairly high level opening that I decided to try out due to its popular usage by Vishwanathan Anand, five-time World Chess Champion and the highest rated Indian Grandmaster. While I attempted to learn some theoretical lines for the opening, I mainly just played the opening by intuition, having played tens of games in the opening when I used to play it. The opening starts **1. c4... 2. Nc3**, with many variations. The opening focuses on controlling the center with a **flank pawn**, the c4 pawn. Furthermore, the opening generally forces an English Opening or a Queen's Gambit position on the board, leading to less transformations into other openings. 

My personal favorite variation of the English Opening was the English Opening, Four Knights, Quiet Line, as shown in the picture! I eventually gave up this opening from my repertoire due to the immense ammount of theory that it theoretically required to be played well after a certain point. I still play it from time to time in my modern repertoire!




### Mixing It Up - Late 2020/Early 2021

#### Playing the Caro-Kann

I soon started to try learning openings with black, since so far, I had been essentially playing the black pieces with basic principles and concepts rather than actual openings. The most major of these was the Caro-Kann, which starts **1. e4 c6**. This opening was a favorite of International Master, Levy Rozman, AKA GothamChess, a popular Chess YouTuber and Twitch Streamer who I watched for chess instruction.

At beginner levels, the Caro-Kann was a powerful tool to surprise completely unprepared opponents. However, against more capable opponents, it was generally quite easy to neutralize and is only rarely still played by me against 1. e4. 


#### Playing the Blackburne-Kloosterboer Gambit

While this was not nearly as popular of an opening choice by me, I wanted to include some more dynamic **gambit** openings into my repertoire. Having experimented with the Scandinavian briefly, I decided to adopt the Scandinavian Defense, Blackburne-Kloosterboer Gambit variation. This gambit goes **1. e4 d5 2. exd5 c6**, gambiting a full pawn in exchange for quicker **development** than my opponent with the move, 3. dxc6 Nxc6. 

While the games played with this opening were always interesting, I eventually stopped playing this opening, instead playing the Caro-Kann, as mentioned above, and future openings with the black pieces.
